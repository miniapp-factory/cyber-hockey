+Mixing BOARD_SIZE constant with canvas.width/height (inconsistent coordinate space)
+
+The code uses BOARD_SIZE (480) for collisions, constraints, goal detection, and reset coordinates, but the actual canvas size is set dynamically to parent size (canvas.width). This will cause collisions, goals, respawn, and clamps to behave incorrectly when the canvas is not exactly 480 px.
+Affected places: wall/corner collision checks (update), goal detection, resetPuck (center uses BOARD_SIZE/2), AI bounds (Math.min(..., BOARD_SIZE - PADDLE_WIDTH)), clamp in handlePointerMove uses canvas.width in y but compares to canvas.width / 2 etc.
+Recommendation: use the canvas actual size (canvas.width and canvas.height) everywhere instead of BOARD_SIZE, or compute a scale factor and transform coordinates consistently.

+Problem:
+The puck is always bounced and clamped a short distance away from the top and bottom edges, while the goals are defined exactly at those edges, so the puck’s center never actually reaches the goal areas. As a result, the goal conditions for both the player and opponent can never become true.
+
+Solution:
+Adjust the physics so the puck is allowed to pass through the top and bottom edges when it’s horizontally within the goal area, instead of bouncing there. Alternatively, move and/or enlarge the visual goal zones so they align with the region where the puck is clamped, ensuring the puck can occupy positions that count as a goal.

+Code the following app
+```
+Create a single-file, responsive React Typescript Cyber Air Hockey game component designed strictly for Portrait Orientation (Vertical Layout).
+
+1. Layout & Dimensions (Portrait Mode)
+
+Orientation: The game board must be vertical.
+
+AI/Enemy Position: Top half of the screen.
+
+Player Position: Bottom half of the screen.
+
+Responsiveness:
+
+On Mobile: The game should occupy 100% of the screen width and height.
+
+On Desktop: The game container should be centered with a maximum width of 480px (simulating a mobile phone view) and a height of 90vh to 100vh. The background outside the game container should be dark/blurred to focus attention on the board.
+
+Field Elements:
+
+A horizontal center line separating the player and enemy territories.
+
+Angled lines at all four corners to prevent the puck from getting stuck in dead zones.
+
+Goal Lines: Located at the very top-center (Enemy Goal) and very bottom-center (Player Goal).
+
+2. Game Flow & UI Screens
+
+Main Menu:
+
+Title: "CYBER HOCKEY".
+
+"Mechanics" Button: Opens a modal or tab explaining controls (drag to move).
+
+"Play" Button: Leads to the Setup Screen.
+
+Setup Screen:
+
+Difficulty Selector:
+
+Easy: AI moves slowly and reacts late.
+
+Medium: Balanced speed and reaction.
+
+Hard: fast movement and predictive blocking.
+
+Time Selector: A slider or input to set the match duration (Minimum: 1 minute, Maximum: 5 minutes).
+
+Start Match Button: Launches the game.
+
+Game Loop (Time & Score Based):
+
+The game runs until the selected timer reaches 0:00.
+
+Scoreboard displayed clearly at the top (AI Score) and bottom (Player Score) or side-by-side in a HUD.
+
+Win Condition: When time expires, the side with the higher score wins. If tied, enter "Sudden Death" (next goal wins).
+
+3. Visual Style (Cyber/Futuristic)
+
+Color Palette: Deep Black/Navy background with Neon Blue (Player theme) and Neon Violet/Purple (Enemy theme).
+
+Effects:
+
+Everything should have a "Glow" effect (CSS box-shadows or bloom).
+
+The Puck should leave a faint trail or have a strong glow.
+
+The UI buttons should look like holographic interfaces.
+
+4. Technical Requirements
+
+Use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
+
+Controls: Touch events (for mobile) and Mouse events (for desktop) to drag the paddle. The paddle must be constrained to its own half of the board.
+
+Place the CyberAirHockey game component on the home page.

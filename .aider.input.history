+Code the following app
+```
+Create a single-file, responsive React Typescript Cyber Air Hockey game component designed strictly for Portrait Orientation (Vertical Layout).
+
+1. Layout & Dimensions (Portrait Mode)
+
+Orientation: The game board must be vertical.
+
+AI/Enemy Position: Top half of the screen.
+
+Player Position: Bottom half of the screen.
+
+Responsiveness:
+
+On Mobile: The game should occupy 100% of the screen width and height.
+
+On Desktop: The game container should be centered with a maximum width of 480px (simulating a mobile phone view) and a height of 90vh to 100vh. The background outside the game container should be dark/blurred to focus attention on the board.
+
+Field Elements:
+
+A horizontal center line separating the player and enemy territories.
+
+Angled lines at all four corners to prevent the puck from getting stuck in dead zones.
+
+Goal Lines: Located at the very top-center (Enemy Goal) and very bottom-center (Player Goal).
+
+2. Game Flow & UI Screens
+
+Main Menu:
+
+Title: "CYBER HOCKEY".
+
+"Mechanics" Button: Opens a modal or tab explaining controls (drag to move).
+
+"Play" Button: Leads to the Setup Screen.
+
+Setup Screen:
+
+Difficulty Selector:
+
+Easy: AI moves slowly and reacts late.
+
+Medium: Balanced speed and reaction.
+
+Hard: fast movement and predictive blocking.
+
+Time Selector: A slider or input to set the match duration (Minimum: 1 minute, Maximum: 5 minutes).
+
+Start Match Button: Launches the game.

+Game Loop (Time & Score Based):
+
+The game runs until the selected timer reaches 0:00.
+
+Scoreboard displayed clearly at the top (AI Score) and bottom (Player Score) or side-by-side in a HUD.
+
+Win Condition: When time expires, the side with the higher score wins. If tied, enter "Sudden Death" (next goal wins).
+
+3. Visual Style (Cyber/Futuristic)
+
+Color Palette: Deep Black/Navy background with Neon Blue (Player theme) and Neon Violet/Purple (Enemy theme).
+
+Effects:

+Everything should have a "Glow" effect (CSS box-shadows or bloom).
+
+The Puck should leave a faint trail or have a strong glow.
+
+The UI buttons should look like holographic interfaces.
+
+4. Technical Requirements
+
+Use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

+Mixing BOARD_SIZE constant with canvas.width/height (inconsistent coordinate space)
+
+The code uses BOARD_SIZE (480) for collisions, constraints, goal detection, and reset coordinates, but the actual canvas size is set dynamically to parent size (canvas.width). This will cause collisions, goals, respawn, and clamps to behave incorrectly when the canvas is not exactly 480 px.
+Affected places: wall/corner collision checks (update), goal detection, resetPuck (center uses BOARD_SIZE/2), AI bounds (Math.min(..., BOARD_SIZE - PADDLE_WIDTH)), clamp in handlePointerMove uses canvas.width in y but compares to canvas.width / 2 etc.
+Recommendation: use the canvas actual size (canvas.width and canvas.height) everywhere instead of BOARD_SIZE, or compute a scale factor and transform coordinates consistently.

+AI instant teleport and no vertical restriction
+
+AI sets opponent paddle x to targetX immediately, causing teleportation and unrealistic movement. Also AI doesn't restrict movement to its half in a robust way (target clamps are based on BOARD_SIZE).
+Recommendation: interpolate AI movement by limiting max speed, and ensure AI only moves within its half (use canvas.height/2 boundary).
